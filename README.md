## Contribution

If you want to contribute, awesome! First, pick an issue and self-assign it. Make your changes in a new branch, with the following naming convention:

Fixing a bug? > "fix_short-description-of-bug"
Implementing a new feature? > "feature_short-description-of-feature"

Once you're satisfied with your changes, create a pull request and give it the label "ready for inspection". You can assign any of the maintainers 
in specific or wait for someone to pick it up. Make sure to include tests and documentation. 
**If TravisCI isn't happy, we're not happy.**

Got stuck with your implementation? Create a pull request with an explanation and give it the label "help wanted".
