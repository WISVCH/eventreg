Hello! This is the documentation of CH Events.

CH Events is a Spring Boot application, Spring Boot is Java (woohoo Java ðŸŽ‰) framework around the Spring platform. Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need.

Spring boot uses the Model-View-Controller, or MVC for short, architectural pattern. Information about the MVC pattern can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller) or just google for MVC pattern.
